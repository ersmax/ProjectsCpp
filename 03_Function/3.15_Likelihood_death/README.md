The Social Security Administration maintains an actuarial life table that contains
the probability that a person in the United States will die (http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/table4c6.html). 
The death probabilities for 2009 are stored in the
file LifeDeathProbability.txt, which is included on the website for the book.
There are three values for each row: the age, the death probability for a male, and
the death probability for a female. For example, the first five lines are

| Exact age | Male death probability | Female death probability |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0.006990 | 0.005728 |
| 1 | 0.000447 | 0.000373 |
| 2 | 0.000301 | 0.000241 |
| 3 | 0.000233 | 0.000186 |
| 4 | 0.000177 | 0.000150 |

The interpretation for the fourth line is that a 3-year-old female has a 0.000186
chance of dying during year 3 to 4.
Write a program that inputs an age and sex from the keyboard in the main function.
The main function should call a function named simulate (that you must
write), sending in the age and sex as parameters. The function should simulate to
what age a person will live by starting with the death probability for the given age
and sex. You can do this by reading the data from the file row by row. Skip rows
that are less than the input age. Once the input age is reached, generate a random
number between 0 and 1, and if this number is less than or equal to the corresponding
death probability, then predict that the person will live to the current age
and return that age. If the random number is greater than the death probability,
then increase the age by one and repeat the calculation for the next row in the file.
If the simulation reaches age 120, then stop and predict that the user will live to 120.
The main function should output the simulated age at which the person will
die. This program is merely a simulation and will give different results each time it 
is run, assuming you change the seed for the random number generator.

# Likelihood of Death in the USA simulator

## Overview
- Small C++ program that simulates the age at which a person will die using an actuarial life table.
- Input: starting `age` and `gender` (`M`/`F`).
- Output: simulated age of death (simulation ends at `MAX_AGE` = 120).

## Files
- `3_programming_set_3/3.15_Likelihood_death/15_Likelihood_death.cpp` — main implementation.
- `3_programming_set_3/3.15_Likelihood_death/likelihood_death_2025.txt` — cleaned data used by the program.
- `3_programming_set_3/3.15_Likelihood_death/README.md` — this file.

## Summary of procedure followed

- Read life‑table file `LifeDeathProbability.txt` once and parse rows into aligned vectors: 
  male death probabilities, female death probabilities;
- Validate and clean fields while parsing (skip empty/malformed lines; 
  convert strings to numeric with `std::stoi`/`std::stod` inside `try`/`catch` 
  and default invalid numeric fields to `0.0`);
- In `main`: user input (integer age and sex flag `M`/`F`);
- Seed once by using the Time of the system;
- Simulation (`simulate(age, sex)`): start at the input age; for each age up to `MAX_AGE`:
    - Draw a random number in \[0,1);
    - Compare to the death probability for that age/gender; 
    - if `random <= probability` return the current age (death occurs that year);
    - otherwise increment age and continue;
    - If `MAX_AGE` is reached return `MAX_AGE`;
- Handle edge cases: if input age > data max treat as `MAX_AGE` (or return input age); 
- Ensure vectors are resized so indexing by age is safe `.resize(age + 1, 0.0)`;
- Implementation notes: preferred loading data into memory for repeated simulations; 
- Keep a small comma‑removal helper available for alternative data formats.

## Data source
- Source figures: Social Security Administration table, 2025: https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/table4c6.html
- The file `likelihood_death_2025.txt` was collected and cleaned locally for this project 
  (the in-code header text referencing 2009 is outdated).

## Build & run
- Open the project in CLion (Windows).
- Run or debug `15_Likelihood_death.cpp` from the IDE.
- Alternatively, compile with a C++17-capable compiler:
  - `g++ -std=c++17 15_Likelihood_death.cpp -o likelihood_sim`
  - `.\likelihood_sim`

## Design notes and function choices

- Reads the life-table file row-by-row and stores male/female death probabilities in two `std::vector<double>` indexed by age.
- Robustness choices:
  - Skips empty or malformed lines.
  - Uses `try`/`catch` around `stoi`/`stod` to avoid crashes on bad fields; invalid numeric fields default to `0.0`.
  - Resizes the vectors as needed so that `male[age]` / `female[age]` are valid.
- This approach favors a single in-memory load so repeated simulations are fast.


## Algorithm
  - Clamp input `age` to `[0, MAX_AGE]`.
  - For each year from the given age up to `MAX_AGE`, draw a uniform random number in \[0,1) 
    and compare it to the death probability for that year and gender.
  - If the random value is <= death probability for that year, return the current age (the person dies during that year).
  - If no death occurs by `MAX_AGE`, return `MAX_AGE`.

## Limitation: RNG choices
  - The program should seed the PRNG once in `main` and use it during simulation 
    to avoid repeated reseeding and global state issues.
  - However, as a simplification, the code uses `rand()` / `srand()` which is simpler 
    but has limitations (small `RAND_MAX`, global state, non-thread-safe, poorer statistical quality). 
    Prefer the C++11 `<random>` (e.g., `std::mt19937` + `std::uniform_real_distribution`) for production.

## A Nice addition: commaRemoval function
- Present in the code as a helper that removes commas from a string.
- Not required for the current `likelihood_death_2025.txt` format (space-separated, already cleaned).
- Kept intentionally for re-use on other fields or alternative data files that may include thousands-separators 
  or comma-containing fields (for example: life expectancy values, number-of-lives columns, or CSV variants). 
  It is a small, safe utility and may be useful if the data source format changes.

## Notes and Suggestions
- The simulation is stochastic: results differ each run unless a fixed RNG seed is used.
- If you prefer reproducible runs for testing, use a fixed seed (e.g., `std::mt19937 rng(12345);`) 
  instead of `std::random_device`.
- The code currently defaults malformed probabilities to `0.0`; 
  change this behavior if you prefer to fail fast or log warnings.
