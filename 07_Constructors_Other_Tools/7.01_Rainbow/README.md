Define a class called RainbowColor that is an abstract data type for a color in the visible spectrum 
of light. 
Your class will have a member variable of type int to represent
a color. Include all the following member functions: a constructor to set the color
using the first letter in the name of the color as an argument, a constructor to set the
color using an integer as an argument, a default constructor, an input function that
reads the color as an integer, an input function that outputs the color as an integer,
an output function that outputs the name of the color, and a member function that
returns the next color in the spectrum as a value of type RainbowColor. Embed your
class definition in a test program.
