Write a rating program for a software development firm with the following rating
policies.
a. Core competency – This parameter measures an employee’s involvement, innovation,
and passion toward their assigned tasks, and is graded on 10 points.
b. Performance evaluation – This parameter measures an employee’s performance
over the year, and is graded on 30 points.
c. Ideation – An employee is measured on their patent submissions, patents
awarded, technical papers presented, etc. and is graded on 10 points.
d. The performance evaluation accounts for 50% of an employee’s final rating,
core competency accounts for 30%, and ideation accounts for 20%.
The total points obtained by an employee are summed up and normalized. Employees
with points of 80 or more are rated a 1, those between 60 to 79 are rated a
2, those between 50 to 59 are rated a 3, and those less than 50 are rated a 4.
The program will read an employee’s points against the three criteria and output
the total points obtained on a scale of 100, and the final rating point. Define and
use a structure for the employee records.
