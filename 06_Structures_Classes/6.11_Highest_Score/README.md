Do Programming Project 5.18 except use only one array as a parameter instead
of two arrays. The single array should be of type Player where Player is a class
that you create. The Player class should have a member variable of type string
to store the player’s name and a member variable of type int to score the player’s
score. Encapsulate these variables appropriately. Upon return from your function
the array entry at index 0 should be set to the name and score of the player with the
best score, the entry at index 1 should be set to the name and score of the player
with the second best score, etc.
